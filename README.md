# What
[Pocket](https://getpocket.com/), while being a great and (thanks god) free service, is still a third-party service

That means if someday, they decide to charge for their service, or even close (hope not!),

what happens with your data is at best, a rush to download before it's always gone

That's why I, along with a lot of other people, believe that owning data is important

This project helps to own your pocket data by fetch pocket entries and inserting them into a sqlite database

I have to give credit and thank [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/), for his great project [pocket-to-sqlite](https://github.com/dogsheep/pocket-to-sqlite), for which I'm greateful and without it, this could've not be done
